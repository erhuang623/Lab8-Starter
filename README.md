How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related because the idea of graceful degradation is that we start with a max technology with functionality like JS for example. Service workers allow the user to access the app even withoout a connection and gives availability offline. When apps rely on unstable things like device quality and a stable internet connection, we will fail the RAIL model if we don't accomodate for this. Service workers allows us to stay in the bounds of RAIL and uphold our features.
